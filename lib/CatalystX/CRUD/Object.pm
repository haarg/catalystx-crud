=head1 NAME

CatalystX::CRUD::Object - an instance returned from a CatalystX::CRUD::Model

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package My::Object;
 use base qw( CatalystX::CRUD::Object );
 
 sub create { shift->delegate->save }
 sub read   { shift->delegate->load }
 sub update { shift->delegate->save }
 sub delete { shift->delegate->remove }
 
 1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CatalystX::CRUD::Model returns instances of CatalystX::CRUD::Object.

The assumption is that the Object knows how to manipulate the data it represents,
typically by holding an instance of an ORM or other data model in the
C<delegate> accessor, and calling methods on that instance.

So, for example, a CatalystX::CRUD::Object::RDBO has a Rose::DB::Object instance,
and calls its RDBO object's methods.

The idea is to provide a common CRUD API for various backend storage systems.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are provided.

=cut

=head2 new

Generic constructor. I<args> may be a hash or hashref.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $arg = ref( $_[0] ) eq 'HASH' ? $_[0] : {@_};
    return $class->next::method($arg);
}

=head2 delegate

The delegate() accessor is a holder for the object instance that the CXCO instance
has. A CXCO object "hasa" instance of another class in its delegate() slot. The
delegate is the thing that does the actual work; the CXCO object just provides a container
for the delegate to inhabit.

Think of delegate as a noun, not a verb, as in "The United Nations delegate often
slept here."


=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

A CXCO subclass needs to implement at least the following methods:

=over

=item create

Write a new object to store.

=item read

Load a new object from store.

=item update

Write an existing object to store.

=item delete

Remove an existing object from store.

=back

=cut

sub create { shift->throw_error("must implement create") }
sub read   { shift->throw_error("must implement read") }
sub update { shift->throw_error("must implement update") }
sub delete { shift->throw_error("must implement delete") }

=head2 AUTOLOAD

Some black magic hackery to make Object classes act like
they are overloaded delegate()s.

=cut

sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $obj            = shift;
    my $obj_class      = ref($obj) || $obj;
    my $delegate_class = ref( $obj->delegate ) || $obj->delegate;
    my $method         = our $AUTOLOAD;
    $method =~ s/.*://;
    return if $method eq 'DESTROY';
    if ( $obj->delegate->can($method) ) {
        return $obj->delegate->$method(@_);
    }

    $obj->throw_error( "method '$method' not implemented in class "
            . "'$obj_class' or '$delegate_class'" );

}

# this overrides the basic can()
# to always call secondary can() on its delegate.
# we have to UNIVERSAL::can because we are overriding can()
# and would otherwise have a recursive nightmare.

=head2 can( I<method> )

Overrides basic can() method to call can() first on the delegate
and secondly (fallback) on the Object class itself.

=cut

sub can {
    my ( $obj, $method, @arg ) = @_;
    if ( ref($obj) ) {

        # object method tries object_class first,
        # then the delegate().
        return UNIVERSAL::can( ref($obj), $method )
            || $obj->delegate->can( $method, @arg );
    }
    else {

        # class method
        return UNIVERSAL::can( $obj, $method );
    }
}

1;
