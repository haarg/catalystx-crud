=head1 NAME

CatalystX::CRUD::Object - an instance returned from a CatalystX::CRUD::Model

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package My::Object;
 use base qw( CatalystX::CRUD::Object );
 
 sub create { shift->delegate->save }
 sub read   { shift->delegate->load }
 sub update { shift->delegate->save }
 sub delete { shift->delegate->remove }
 
 1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CatalystX::CRUD::Model returns instances of CatalystX::CRUD::Object.

The assumption is that the Object knows how to manipulate the data it represents,
typically by holding an instance of an ORM or other data model in the
C<delegate> accessor, and calling methods on that instance.

So, for example, a CatalystX::CRUD::Object::RDBO has a Rose::DB::Object instance,
and calls its RDBO object's methods.

The idea is to provide a common CRUD API for various backend storage systems.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are provided.

=cut

=head2 new

Generic constructor. I<args> may be a hash or hashref.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $arg = ref( $_[0] ) eq 'HASH' ? $_[0] : {@_};
    return $class->SUPER::new($arg);
}

=head2 delegate

The delegate() accessor is a holder for the object instance that the CXCO instance
has. A CXCO object "hasa" instance of another class in its delegate() slot. The
delegate is the thing that does the actual work; the CXCO object just provides a container
for the delegate to inhabit.

Think of delegate as a noun, not a verb, as in "The United Nations delegate often
slept here."


=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

A CXCO subclass needs to implement at least the following methods:

=over

=item create

Write a new object to store.

=item read

Load a new object from store.

=item update

Write an existing object to store.

=item delete

Remove an existing object from store.

=back

=cut

sub create { shift->throw_error("must implement create") }
sub read   { shift->throw_error("must implement read") }
sub update { shift->throw_error("must implement update") }
sub delete { shift->throw_error("must implement delete") }

1;
