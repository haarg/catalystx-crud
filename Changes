        * oops. actually include the tutorial pod in this release.

0.16    04 Dec 2007
        * fix typo in Tutorial so it shows up in search.cpan.org
        * fix Controller->do_search() to always include query for view's use,
        even when there are no results.

0.17    19 Dec 2007
        * add field_names() method to base Controller class. This is to aid development
        of CatalystX::CRUD::View implementations.

0.18    20 Dec 2007
        * added _no_page parameter support to the Model API.
        * added ::Model::Utils to help with DRY

        * fix view_on_single_result() to check can_write()

        * fix black magic can() in Model.pm

0.22    04 Jan 2008
        * add treat_like_int() support to Model::Utils

0.23    20 Jan 2008
        * added REST API
        * added allow_GET_writes Controller config option, to prevent casual GET /save or /delete requests.

0.24    22 Jan 2008
        * always fetch() in REST->default, to fix bug with no object being set for create()
        * always uc() the req method for comparison purposes
        * fix bug when checking the _http_method param to use params() instead of param() and use the first if multiple.
        * refactor REST to provide backwards compat with Controller for easy @ISA swap (as advertised)

0.25    1 Feb 2008
        * fix bug to clarify what happens when form_to_object() returns false.

0.26    06 May 2008
        * fix bug in Iterator to test for !next() rather than !defined(next())
        * re-set action in ::REST->default so that RPC-style template naming works
        * use :Path instead of :Private on ::REST->default
        * fix several bugs with action() set in ::REST
        * ::Controller->form now calls NEXT::form. This is for REST compat and @INC oddness.
        * added new ::ModelAdapter class and refactored base Controller to use it.
        * moved make_pager() from base ::Model to ::Model::Utils
        * added new ::Test classes to ease writing controller-agnostic tests.
        * new, optional 'make_query' method in Controller.
        * move AUTOLOAD() and can() hackery out of base Model into base Object where it belongs.
          Now there is only 2 sins instead of the 3 in previous releases (where we no longer
          monkey-patch the subs at run time).
        * refactor tests to actually perform some CRUD.
        * add ::ModelAdapter::File example.
        * add envvar CXCRUD_TEST in base CX::CRUD to cluck() stack traces on exceptions. Mostly
          useful during testing since the ::Test::Controller now returns only the error.
        * renamed 'buffer' to 'content' in ::Object::File.
        * ::Model::File->fetch() will now always return an object even if it does not yet
          exist on the filesystem.
        * change default create() method in Controller to call methods directly instead of forward()ing.
        * add create() method to REST that just redirects to create_form().
        * change from 'use NEXT' to 'use Class::C3'
        * added support for "x-tunneled-method" param to REST controller in addition to "_http_method". 
          This is for compat with Catalyst::Request::REST::ForBrowsers.

0.27    12 June 2008
        * fix Controller->rm() to check for model_adapter() and call its delete() method as advertised.
        * check for length($oid) instead of defined($oid) in REST->default
        * added CatalystX::CRUD::Results class
        * added naked_results() config option to base Controller
        * refactored base Controller to make all config options into accessors. added t/02-controller
        * change Model::Utils to use req->params rather than param()
